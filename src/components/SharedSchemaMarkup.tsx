    question: "Is Twent really free?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Right now, everything is completely free. All 50+ tools, the Ubuntu terminal, overlay agent, MCP servers, skills, workflows — the whole thing. We're in pre-revenue and focused on building the best agent OS, not paywalling features.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you distribute the app if it's not on the Play Store?",
    answer:
      "We distribute the APK directly from our website. Download, install, and you're good to go. No middleman, no store fees, no waiting for approval.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will there be ads?",
    answer:
      "Eventually, yes — powered by AI ads (koahlabs.com). They'll be non-intrusive and contextually relevant. A future Pro plan ($20) will remove them entirely, along with cosmetic badges, early access features, and zero marketplace commissions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the marketplace?",
    answer:
      "The marketplace is an upcoming agentic app store — users can sell skills, workflows, plugins, and MCP servers. It doesn't exist yet. Once we move to the Play Store and start generating revenue, marketplace commissions will fund the free tier. Pro users ($20) get zero commissions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between free now and Pro later?",
    answer:
      "Right now: everything is free, Website APK distribution, AI ads, no marketplace, no cosmetic badges. Later (post-revenue): Play Store distribution, everything still free, AI ads, marketplace with commissions, and Pro ($20) for ad removal, cosmetic badges, early access features, and zero marketplace commissions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why not just put it on the Play Store now?",
    answer:
      "Play Store means reviews, fees, and slower iteration. We're moving fast — shipping features weekly, breaking things, fixing them. Website APK distribution lets us do that. Once we're stable and generating revenue, Play Store is the move.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I download from Play Store or from the APK?",
    answer:
      "Download from Play Store. It is much easier to install and setup. The APK is only for the rare cases if you want to get the absolute (updated 1 hour ago) latest version which is actually very unstable and buggy and unpolished. So yeah, avoid APK and go download from Play Store. There is absolutely 0% difference between the two in terms of features they offer. There is no reason to get the APK (it is actually worse), but if you still want it, here it is: https://twent.xyz/apk",
